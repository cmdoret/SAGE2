## Sequence A Genome 2, Group 4

### Supervised by Olivier Emery

In this project, we analyse the gene content of various Lactobacillus strains and investigate what genes are specific to bumblebee and honeybee hosts.

This repository contains the code required to re-run the analysis of host specific gene content.

To run the analysis from scratch, simply ```cd``` to the main directory and type ```make``` on the command line.
